 # Mental Health in the Tech Industry Project
 ## Objective
 The objective of this project is to explore the Mental Health in Tech (years 2014, and 2016-2018) survey data and provide insights of how mental health issues are dealt with in the tech workplace as well as potentially find a further direction for research.
 ## Conclusions
- Women and people of other gender denominations generally report mental health diagnoses more than men. One possible explanation for this could be that men are less likely to go seek out mental health support.
- Generally all age groups report mental health disorders to similar extent.
- There is very little difference in mental health reports between self-employed and non-self-employed people.
- Most tech worker are not sure or believe that being labeled with mental illness would hurt their career. About a third of people that underwent this experience reported that it actually hurt their careers.
- From 2014 to 2016 the amount of people that would not bring up mental health in a job interview decreased by around 20% (From around 80% to 60%) yet in following years (2016-2018) the distrust of bringing up mental health seemed to embody an upwards trend.
- Generally tech employees have low opinions of the support that their companies provide.
- Mental health condition diagnosis is similar for most tech workers: most of them get diagnosed with anxiety disorders followed by depression.
